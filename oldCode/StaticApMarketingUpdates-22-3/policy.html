                            <p>1.1 When you use the Web Site, you acknowledge and agree that you may have to provide Us the
                                following User-provided and usage-based information:</p>

                            <p>1.2 Analytics information:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a) We may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure
                                traffic and usage trends for the Web Site.<br>
                                (b) We do not collect other information such as the web pages you visit, add-ons, or other
                                information that occurs outside your use of the Web Site. What limited Web Site-specific
                                information we do collect is done in such a way that it cannot reasonably be used to
                                identify any particular individual user.</p>
                            <p>1.3 Cookies and other similar technologies</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a) We do use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web
                                beacons, and local storage to track usage, analytics, social media, and advertisements.</p>
                            <p>1.4 Log file</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a) When you use our Web Site, our servers may automatically
                                record certain log file information, including date and time of your web request, Internet
                                Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and
                                how a user interacts with links on the Web Site, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed,
                                and other such information. We may also collect similar information from SMS sent to our
                                users which then help us track which SMS are opened and which links are clicked by
                                recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Web
                                Site; however, this information cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular
                                individual user unless they are logged into the Web Site.</p>
                            <p>1.5 Device identifiers and metadata:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a) When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access
                                our Web Site, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store
                                one or more "device identifiers". Device identifiers are small data files or similar data
                                structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your
                                mobile device, but not you as an individual.<br>
                                (b) A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data
                                stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to
                                the device by Us. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party
                                partner about how you browse and use the Web Site and may help us or others provide reports.
                                Some features of the Web Site may not function properly if use or availability of device
                                identifiers is impaired or disabled. This information cannot reasonably be used to identify
                                any particular individual user unless they are logged into the Web Site..<br>
                                (c) Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with user submitted content. For
                                example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of user content was collected
                                and how that content is formatted.</p>

                                technically able. We reserve the right to disclose information about you to government or
                                law enforcement officials, or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
                                necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited
                                to subpoenas), at the request of governmental authorities or other third parties conducting

                                have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to
                                legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith
                                belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that
                                jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also
                                access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to:
                                detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and
                                others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
                                Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended
                                period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
                                investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or
                                otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
                            <p>5.2 You understand that we can be legally prohibited from disclosing the existence or
                                non-existence of a legal request for your information.</p>
                            <p>5.3 If we receive a request from a jurisdiction and we believe that request to be
                                inequitable, not lawful, or not consistent with internationally recognized standards, we may
                                not comply with that request. As a result, you understand and agree that you may lose access
                                to the Web Site in that jurisdiction. You further understand and agree that we will not
                                provide any refund or compensation for any loss to you or any other party under such
                                circumstances.</p>

                                the material; and<br>

                                the Service.</p>
                            <p>4.5 Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent</p>
                            <p>If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to
                                which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user
                                believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the
                                copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must
                                send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed
                                below:</p>
                            <p>(a) A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;<br>
                                (b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been
                                disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or
                                disabled;<br>
                                (c) A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the
                                material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the
                                material; and<br>
                                (d) The content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if
                                available, email address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the
                                jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's,
                                member's or user's address is located, or if the content provider's, member's or user's
                                address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which MyJoVE is
                                located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who
                                provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
                            <p>4.6 Removal</p>
                            <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, MyJoVE may send a copy of the
                                counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace
                                the removed material or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright
                                owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user,
                                the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in ten (10) to fourteen (14)
                                business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at MyJoVE's discretion.</p>

                                effect to the state's conflicts of law statute. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND
                                US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP
                                WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE

                                nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered
                                by this Agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE WAIVING THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS

                                capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to
                                the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal
                                Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. Judgment on the award
                                rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any
                                provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award
                                damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service.</p>
